# Raffely {#identifier .heading1}


## Background
The Schofield Lions Club (Wisconsin) is a very active club and puts on numerous events
each year. Most events entail some kind of raffle. A raffle can vary depending on what class they are regulated under. In Wisconsin, there are two types of raffles,
[Class A license](/documents/ClassALicense.pdf) and [Class B license](/documents/ClassBLicense.pdf). Rafflely is interested in providing digital solutions for both
types of raffles, but the initial focus will be Class B types of raffles which are
also knowns as multiple-container raffles or single-container raffles.

With multiple-container raffles, there will be a set of prizes with a wide variety of
different items that people can win. A person can only purchase tickets on the day
of the raffle. After a person purchases the tickets, they will then be able to go
and put their tickets in whatever containers they would like. What Rafflely is trying
to do is streamline the process of raffle sign-up, participation, and notification.
When a person comes to buy a set of raffle tickets, the current process is writing down
that person's full name and their phone number. Once the raffle has been drawn, the
raffle winner's tickets are posted on the container that they won. If the winner is
not there, they are manually sent a text by the raffle organizer.

Rafflely can take the tedious process of having to do everything manually and automate
the process along with providing additional features to both the organizers and
participants. By inputing data digitally, we can access the power of automating
processes that can take a lot of time and are also prone to error. With Rafflely,
event organizers will be able to also capture their participant base to help inform
them on upcoming raffles. After a raffle has been drawn, text messages can be sent
automatically to the winners informing them what they won with instructions to claim
their prize. It will also give event organizer's the ability to award recurring
participants and encourage other participants to come back in the future.
